# Contributing

If you find a bug, please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/icflorescu/mantine-datatable/issues).  
If you have an idea about a new or missing feature, let's discuss it [here](https://github.com/icflorescu/mantine-datatable/discussions).

Better yet, if you're willing to put your effort into it, coming up with a pull-request would be fantastic.  
So many people _take open-source for granted_, but far fewer understand its true essence and are generous enough to contribute their own time and skills to a project they find useful.  
If you're here though, you're probably one of the fewer ones.

**NOTE:**
New features are developed in the `next` branch, so make sure to target your PRs accordingly.
If you want to implement a new feature or improve an existing one, make sure to also add an example page and/or alter the one(s) already referring to it. It’t not a feature if other people don’t know about it or don’t understand how to use it.
